                    <p>No need to dwell on what happened before and after, or talk about topics that have nothing to do.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Your photo must be in direct contact with this professional.</p>
                    <p>The form: the quality of your content</p>

                    <p>To share an opinion or a photo is to bring concrete and useful information to the whole community.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Your opinion needs to be written well enough to be understandable, and detailed enough to be helpful.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Your photo must be well framed, sharp, large enough and clear to be identifiable and bring out a general impression.</p>
                    <p>Do we respect each other</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Your opinion is negative? You have the right ! Avoid any form of aggression or defamation vis-&agrave;-vis the professional.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Some information should not be mentioned at all because it violates privacy and is against the law. In particular :</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal information: employees' last name, website, phone number, ...</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible actions taken in court.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>An invoice or a ticket can be attached to your opinion. To be taken into account, it must be legible and related to the experience you describe in your opinion. If your proof could not be taken into account, you can not send it back. Keep the reflex for next time!</p>
                    <p>The case of activities related to the human health sector</p>
                    <p>The Latoo.fr site is not a medical site: it does not allow remote consultation or the issue of prescriptions. It only allows to gather the opinion of patients Users on the general reception which was reserved to them by the practitioner, without being able to involve judgment on the competence even of the practitioner or on the medical act in itself</p>
                    <p>Your contribution has not been published. Why ?</p>
                    <p>Moderation</p>

                    <p>Your review or photo may not be published. Do not panic ! Most of the time, just tweak your message or choose another photo for your message to be published. We explain our reasons here.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your photo must also be in direct contact with this professional by showing for example the entrance or the interior of his establishment, the course of his performance ...</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express yourself clearly</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write clearly, with short and intelligible sentences, avoid abbreviations, SMS language or excessive punctuation (??? or !!! for example).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the rating that you assign to the professional should be consistent with the opinion you share.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be precise and detailed</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your opinion should give as much information as possible about your experience: its progress, your impressions, the positive or negative points ... The more precise and concrete your explanations are, the more relevant and therefore useful you will be!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, give him a clear and explicit title to be understood by the community!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, a picture already published by you or by others can not be duplicated.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful, taking a word-for-word notice or copying a photo may result in the deactivation of your account.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In writing your opinion, stay calm, objective and moderate. Constructive criticism is more relevant and will be better understood.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid words such as "hustler", "thief", "crook", "dishonest", who give an aggressive tone to your subject and may equate it with defamation.
